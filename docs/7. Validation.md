# PHPFUI\ORM Validation
*__Note__: Referenced namespaces in this document refer to the **PHPFUI\ORM** defaults.*

Validator is an abstract class for Record validation See [\PHPFUI\ORM\Validator](http://phpfui.com/?n=PHPFUI%5CORM&c=Validator) namespace for examples.

Individual validators are listed in the table below. Validators can be combined.  For example, a field can be **required**, and have a **minlength** and **maxlength**. Validators can have parameters. Parameters are separated by a colon (:) and then commas for each separate parameter.

## Usage

```php
$record = new \App\Record\Example();
$record->setFrom($_POST);
$validationErrors = $record->validate();
if (! validationErrors)
  {
  $insertedId = $record->insert();
  }
```
$validationErrors is an array indexed by field name containing an array of translated errors.
```php
foreach ($validationErrors as $field => $fieldErrors)
  {
  echo "Field {$field} has the following errors:\n";
  foreach ($fieldErrors as $error)
	  {
	  echo $error . "\n";
	  }
  }
```

## Field Comparison Validators
You can compare one field to another on the same Record with the field validators.
* gt_field
* lt_field
* gte_field
* lte_field
* eq_field
* neq_field

Field validators take another field name as a parameter and perform the specified condition test. To compare against a specific value, use minvalue, maxvalue, equal or not_equal.

## Unique Parameters
Without any parameters, the **unique** validator will make sure no other record has a matching value for the field being validated. The current record is always exempted from the unique test so it can be updated.

If there are parameters, the first parameter must be a field of the current record. If this is the only parameter, or if the next parameter is also a field of the record, then the unique test is only done with the value of this field set to the current record's value.

If the next parameter is not a field of the record, it is used as a value to match for the preceeding field for the unique test.

The above repeats until all parameters are exhausted.

**Examples:**

Suppose you have a table with the following fields:
* name
* company
* division
* type

You want the name to be unique per company: *unique:company*
You want the name to be unique per division with in the company: *unique:company,division*
You want the name to be unique for a specific type in the division: *unique:type,shoes,division*
You want the name to be unique for a specific type and division: *unique:type,shoes,division,10*

## Optional Validation
You may need to do additional checks for a specific record type.  A second parameter can be passed to the contructor which would represent the original values of the record.

You can also pass an optional method to validate to perform more complex validation. If you use an optional method, the validator will not perform the standard validations unless you specifically call the validate() method again without the optional method parameter.

## Multi Validator Example
```php
class Order extends \PHPFUI\ORM\Validator
	{
	/** @var array<string, string[]> */
	public static array $validators = [
		'order_date' => ['required', 'maxlength', 'datetime', 'minvalue:2000-01-01', 'maxvalue:2099-12-31'],
		];
	}
```
