# PHPFUI\ORM Transactions
While PHPFUI\ORM supports the traditional beginTransaction(), commit() and rollBack() on the PDO object, it is recommended you use the \PHPFUI\ORM\Transaction class.

```php
$transaction = new \PHPFUI\ORM\Transaction();
// do some stuff
if ($allGood)
  {
  $transaction->commit();
  }
else
  {
  $transaction->rollBack();
  }
```
The above creates a transaction on the current database.  Commit and rollback will also be called on the correct database even if you are working on another database at the time.

The main advantage of a Transaction object, it that will will rollback any changes on a thrown exception assuming the transaction object is properly scoped.
